### README - Contract Integration using React js
This program is about intergrating a smart contract to react js so that the front end can interact with the contract.

# Steps to start
1. Open three terminals in your VS code
2. In the first terminal type: npx hardhat node. Make sure your metamask network connects to hardhat local.
3. In the second terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
4. in the third terminal, type npm run start to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
